#### git stash
- Use `git stash` to save code temporarily, you could restore it by u1sing `git stash apply index` or `git stash pop index`. Of course there is `git stash list` or `git stash clear`...[ref](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-stash)
- Use `git reflog show`, and then you could recover from `git reset --hard` you had done.
